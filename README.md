# Search for Human-Centric Data Spaces (SEA) Project
## About
A search engine for human-centric Data Spaces, as defined by the European Strategy of Data, 
aiming at fostering data-driven innovation, and a demonstration of AI model training for energy 
consumption prediction, using data generated by IoT devices installed in smart homes.

## Objectives
SEA will develop a search engine for Data Spaces, a new form of digital platform 
aiming at deliberating data from silos in order to enable data-driven innovations
 and shape digital transformation. SEA will focus on human-centric Data Spaces, 
 used for securely sharing personal data, it will target domain experts searching 
 for reliable data (e.g., for scientific calculations, or for AI model training), 
 it will be accessible by both humans and machines, and it will provide semantic 
 interoperability, trust, and openness. 
 
 ## Technologies
SEA will build upon the [iSHARE](https://ishare.eu/)-certified system developed by 
ExcID and Plegma, which uses [FIWARE](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/) 
technology and [W3C's self-sovereign identification and authorization standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) 
to enable secure and controlled IoT data sharing. The developed solution will be 
demonstrated through a proof-of-concept, which will allow searching for data that 
can be used for training an AI model for energy consumption prediction.
